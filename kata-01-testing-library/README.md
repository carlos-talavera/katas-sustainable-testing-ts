# Kata 01 - Testing Library

In this kata, a basic testing library is developed. This library resembles popular libraries such as [Jest](https://jestjs.io) and [Vitest](https://vitest.dev).

## Compile the project

To compile the project, run:

```shell
npm run compile
```

## Watch for changes

To make changes and automatically update the build, run:

```shell
npm run compile:watch
```

## Run tests

To run the tests, which are located in the `src/math.test.ts` file, you have to run the output file `lib/math.test.js`:

```shell
node lib/math.test.js
```
